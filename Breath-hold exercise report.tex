\section*{\textbf{\emph{ABSTRACT}} }
This research was done to findout whether there is a gender
difference that affects how long one holds their breath. According to
scientific research, men are known to have a larger lung volume
hence prolonged breath hold time. This report shows that on average,
men have proved to have a slightly longer breath hold type than women.

\section{\textbf{INTRODUCTION} } 
Men will have a higher or lower lung volume than girls. The time
 one can take to hold their breath is based on indivdual size, gender, health,
age, ethnicity and geographical location. These are factors tht cause a
variation. Likewise taller people have a larger lung volume than short people.
Being athletic and in good shape also increases lung volume while health
conditions and the lack of exercise can reduce it. The time
one can take to hold their breat is mainly based on their lung volume.

\section{\textbf{METHODOLOGY} } 
\textbf{-} In this exercise, i will compare the time one can hold their breath with regard to the difference between genders while eliminating the differences caused by the previously mentioned variables.\\ 
\textbf{-}Lung volume is the amount of air a lung can hold.\\
\textbf{-}A sample of individuals will undergo a breathing exercise where they are
required to hold their breath for as long as they can take it.\\
\textbf{-}The exercise will be done on an equal number of males and females between the ages of 18 to 30.

\section{\textbf{RESULTS} } 
The results tabulated below are a sample of the data that was collected. Participants 1 to 5 are female. Participants 6 to 10 are male.

\section{\textbf{CONCLUSIONS} } 
The average breath hold time for females according to the undertaken experiments above is 37.05seconds and that of males is 44.07 seconds. According to the results tabulated above, a numerical analysis shows that males have  longer breath hold time as compared to the females.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\
